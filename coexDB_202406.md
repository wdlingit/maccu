## Database collection, 202406

We are making efforts on collecting read counts, postprocessing, and building database tables. We are now working on a few model species. Available updates of database files can be found at this [link](https://myspace.sinica.edu.tw/public.php?service=files&t=jDXOZs51J0OP81ccJX86JeFpEXUvOlUGXJZZIr2c_VRVdwh7wQSLG7qEPFa5HBhK) (cloud storage page of Academia Sinica). Also see [our approaches](https://github.com/wdlingit/maccu/blob/main/DB_from_DEE2.md) for downloadeding specified SRS metadata and classifying samples.

### Command line download example

*NOTE*: Due to file size limitation, files larger than 2GB were split into smaller files of the same prefix. All file splits are needed for extracting the database files. A (rather) convenient way to download specific files is to copy the file links from the cloud storage page and use `curl` as in the following example:

```
